# Strezless-Musick

Omar Dejesu Orrantia going through a emotional setback changed a headline on his personal profile on Facebook saying 'Sin Estres viviendo' meaning Living without Stress or as the artist himself like to translate it to, "Strezless living."
One day arriving to work as I was getting ready to cross the street to work because employees were not allowed to park in the small parking lot of this family owned local Laredo restaurant a car zoomed passed me and someone cheered at me saying "Ese Sin Estres" a form of greeting someone and recognition is something today boosts a self esteem especially makes one feel less lost in this world because it gives a sense of belonging and purpose. I have no idea who the person was cause the car was out of my sight quicker than I could respond but I thought about that for a good while as I was clocking in to my afternoon shift and getting ready for my tasks at hand. That didn't sound so bad I thought, Sin Estres actually is perfect I thought yeah, after all these dramas and unpromising dark and dangerous valleys I've had to walk through and endure always leaving me feeling like I'm a failure, my life is definitely ruined now, no more hope and despondent as hell wondering if I was gonna be able to live through a certain circumstance causing my psychological order to lose it's center and head in a steady direction to be and live a normal life as some call it it always leaves me mentally impaired to make good choices and I end up being a burden and maybe a candidate for government assistance as a disabled or incompetent individual by which I would be forced to live off federal public assistance if I even plan to have a place to go sleep every night or day.
I said if I think about it in a spiritual sense Jesus does say don't worry about anything so my name could mean Sin Estres could signify faith in God so don't worry about things will turn out fine cause God is in control.
Or coming from a street life myself knowing the evil of heartless selfish backstabbing goons and hoodrats whom I like to refer to as Snakes Iscariots descendents of Cain and Judas the one who would betray the most undeserving of having a traitor be the cause of his death so I've seen the same spirit at play in so many people it's disturbing to me so much because I know it's a spirit that makes us think the most wicked ideas when there's no light of God's word rooted in our hearts and I learned that the hard way so for my haters I like to say my name means I don't give a F." I worry about nothing anymore at least not as much as before. I don't worry about the common things that most would but the only thing that would and does bother me is people's lives, especially those that have impacted me in a good way and have left these soft feelings of concern because he moment someone I love is laid to rest and I can't hear, touch. Nor talk to said individuals ever again my mind glooms into despair and I lose that desire to keep on with my life in this world because even rewards and anything you would think it's success like being financially set for the rest of ones life means nothing because that free time would have been spent with those who no longer live and they took a part of me also. So it's only time for more self destructive behavior that becomes our soon demise if we don't get right on time to be able to rectify and mend the road in the right direction instead of haulingin that wide road leading to destruction we were on and so yea if ever I stress it's for life because a life means more to me than anything this world has to offer. A million dollar car, a million dollar house, a billion dollar enterprise and anything even a country if destroyed is something sad of course it certainly would be nothing to smile about or even less a call for celebration but think about it, there's something that can be done and maybe not get all back due to the limited time we as humans have on earth but it can be someway to fix it and get it back even if it's downgraded but if we are persistent and faithful God can bless us tenfold more like Job and you end up having way more than you ever dreamed of or imagined. But a life, a life once it's gone it's gone for good and the the desperate heartbroken loved ones left to mourn can find no other way to express the pain we feel knowing this special person who has now closed their eyes is not coming back and that can kill us in every way if God didn't comfort us with His promises of resurrecting us again one day which I so stubbornly believe it's true with all I am let God be found truthful and every man a liar. He's gonna do it again and to fulfill the purpose that God in His great knowledge and foresight had destined for me before I was born to fulfill. I wanna win the spiritual war above all and be someone that satan was not successful to corrupt eternally. I see now help me God, I want to be genuine and love in truth judging things righteously not viciously and having that faith that reaches the most loving point of that immense love you have for me and everyone you have created in your image. I want to know why and how Jesus loves the way He did and how is it possible to love even those who wished death on me because if not by your might I will surely fail and hate also like I have plenty of times before I knew anything deeply of you and your Word. Miracle will give us a heart rich in love and grace you'll the light.
