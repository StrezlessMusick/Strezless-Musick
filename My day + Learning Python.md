# My day + Learning Python

I walked for a pretty long time today. I walked to a great person I consider an angel in the flesh because of how sweet she is. Lois is the name of an elderly woman who has a beatiful heart and I met her last year when I lived with the vietnamese guys who were definitely very wild. I had my good and bad memories with them but one day as I was wareting on of the asians names garden it so happened the neighbor was watering her own garden as they both loved to grow their own crops and that is where she broke the ice starting  conversation with me. We talked about where I was from and she talked a bit about her I honestly just don't remember what she said but I know for sure she has become a sweet lady in my life for sure. I will forever be grateful to her for the love she has shone me and today I was more than delighted to see her again. I am back in Lubbock, TX again but this time I don't plan to make the same mistakes as before, may God bless me and help me stay away from the things that had negatively impacted my life and may I fulfill the plan He has prepared for me since before I was born. Thank you Jesus. anyways I also learned a bit of coding on my app called Programming Hub which basically introduces the users the basics of almost all the computer programming languages we can use for a computer to perform a task we want it to do. I learned a bit about the Hello World and the way to get the screen to display that on the end users screen so I changed it to expirement on my code from print("Hello World") to print("Strezless Musick Productionz") and also about the commenting on each line with the # sign and writing a bit of the code printed to let other users understand what the code printed is for. I just began the variables as well as that is the way to store everything in it's own folder and keep it organized instead of having a mess with all the files  all over my system which makes it harder for me to find what I need to find so much because it's not found in the download section. Will review and edit this journal entry later because I been sleepy so I keep doziing off and awakening to force to finish writing my entry. I am grateful for my day.
