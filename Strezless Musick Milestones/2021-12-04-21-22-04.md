# Strezless Musick Journaling

This is what I mostly spent the day doing online today, updating my resume which should have been completed days ago but it is not really that I was procrastinating but I was stalling due to other things going on in my life that were really negatively impacting my well being. I am still in love with someone whom I could not get through to anymore unfortunately I believe it's like this one lover of mine unlike ever before was snatched out of my life suddenly because though I knew almost from the time we met the condition of said persons health, it was to late for me to be able to rethink and pull away from someone whom my most selfless inner side of me had already got seduced by. I wanted to be there for the rest of my ex life and had made a decision to overlook almost all the imperfections that we all have in common as humans but I was not forgiven for voicing the disagreements and negative treatment I soon began to expirience by my ex that it tore me apart and for a good while I was not able to cope with rationalizing my thoughts and building the strength to get my composure together to move on and do things the way I've been accustomed to most of my life, alone since I lost my only parent that truly had the unconditional love so desired by most of humanity and ever since I have come to know without a shadow of a doubt that we abide in a Cold Wide World. I'm back in Lubbock again and may God bless my new priorities and the workings of my hands cause I don't plan to quit nor give up anytime soon. Registered songs with the MLC and still figuring out the copyrights registration process and the process to cleanly organize and administer my works metadata and successfully launch my publishing business called Strezless Musick Productionz founded and ran by non other than I, Sin Estres now live for streamers enthusiasts listening delights. Thank you to all and any who have been showing me support from the beginning by subscribing to my YouTube channel and maybe sharing something I produced and shared to the public that you liked. To my team that has been patiently waiting my next move and been invited by me still on my messenger group chat just know that your patience has not been overlooked nor forgotten, I just had major setbacks that I have let go of now to continue where I left of and it's a pleasure to say with the confidence of a already successful performer, I'm back baby and unless I am taken out this world when GOD in His perfect timing chose to allow me to pass then I ain't going nowhere but maybe to a city near you to perform and/or present my works that are yet in production proccess, brace yourselves cause God is good and I know HE shall be true to His promises in my life, He already has proven His grace and love for me by letting me survive these valleys of the shadow of death I've been through and I know He will complete the good work He began in me now years ago. I'm ready baby. Be safe everyone and Happy Hollidays to you all who have the loving family I never had since my mother passed in 01, cherish every single moment together and do not neglect the time God has given you to be together because realize we all don't have the blessing to have it for much of a time and you will never know the pain of not knowing what you had til it's gone. Don't wait to have regrets, choose the right thing to love your family in spirit and truth and watch it all fall in place on it's own. Peace out.]
